# JSON Editor
Just having fun with Windows Forms.

[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)

## Todo
- finish implementing the ToString() method for objects and arrays
- work out the logic for mapping a JSON document onto the TreeView
- when adding a node to the treeview, store the JSONElement object in the "tag" property
- create a "new element" dialog window
- call things elements instead of nodes
- menubar or toolbar with load and save buttons
- contextmenustrips and key combos (e.g., ctrl+s for save) and all that jazz
- figure out how to reorder elemnts
- separate primitives into their own classes?
- add debugging thing that prints out the current JSON document
